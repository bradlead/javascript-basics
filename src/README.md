# JavaScript Basics

This repository is amined at helping you to get to grips with the basics of problem-solving in JavaScript.
It will also introduce you to writing code against unit tests.

The repository contains a load of test cases to solve the different challenges set in the week 2 walkthrough.

Your challenge is to get all of the tests passing.

We have provided all of the empty functions for you, you just have to fill in the logic.

## Getting started

First up, create a fork of this repo.

Then clone your copy of the repo:
- `git clone git@github.com:*your-github-username*/javascript-basics.git`

Then `cd` into the repository and run `npm install`.

## Running tests

To run the tests, run `npm test`

This will run the tests cases using **[Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)**.

You can also run an individual test suite.  
For example to run just the arrays suite, you can run `npm test -- arrays`
